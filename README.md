# Dot

## Design research

### Common features in human-interacting robots
* White in colour
* Large bright eyes, almost anime-like in style
* Cartoon like features: Soft curves, no edges, sometimes blob like
* In most cases, childlike in appearance
* About as tall as a 5-10 year old child
* The robot's screen either serves a dual-purpose as its face and interaction point, or is appended to their chest
* Has human features, such as hands, face, eyes, but avoids making them look too realistic
* Its face can convey cartoon like expressions such as: happiness, anger (in a cute way), distress (also in a cute way)
* Have some form of body-language that resemble what a human does

### Reasons for these design choices
* Large eyes, soft features, childlike appearance, and body language make the robot seem non-threatening, approachable, friendly, and cute (Cook, 2018). Very important for if you are dealing with real humans. White colour adds to this, as it is associated with safety, innocence and cleanliness (Cherry, 2020).
	
* Allows the robot to be used in a variety of contexts without needing to change the design, which saves on production costs. For example, this particular model of robot has been used as a gimmick for a store front ([www.youtube.com/watch?v=v931a6sPUZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v931a6sPUZw)) and as a lecturer ([www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amfrm2V_KO0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amfrm2V_KO0)).

* Avoids crossing the uncanny valley, which is probably the most important aspect of the design. If you attempt to make a robot that looks *too* much like a real person, it will end up looking surreal, strange or sometimes creepy (Azarian, 2016).

    While the AI is very impressive, the jerky mouth and hand movements are off putting.

### How this applies to Dot
* Dot's current design has several of the the above features, including a cute cartoony design, and avoids the uncanny valley, but resembles a penguin more than a human. While penguins are both cute and friendly-looking, it limits the contexts in which Dot can be used. The penguin design would be visually appropriate in the arctic section of a zoo, but not much else. Switching to a more human-blob-like design may increase the approachability of Dot in the context we want it to be used for.

* While complicated body-language may be out of reach considering our resources, cartoonish facial expressions *should* be fairly straightforward to implement. Not only would this give Dot a bit more depth, but would also be effective for comedic effect or an "aww" factor. A few examples:
  * If Dot gets stuck, beads of sweat could appear and their eyes could screw up as it tries to free itself. 
  * If someone taps on Dot's screen before it has initiated a quiz proper, it could display a cartoony angry face or one of discomfort.
  * An extra happy face when someone completes the quiz, says "thank you" or something along those lines.
