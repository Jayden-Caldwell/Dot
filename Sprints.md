Sprints
=======

### Sprint 1

Completed the prototype for the GUI using python with tkinter module. To get the gifs working we had to also download an animationGif module.

The python program for controlling the roomba via the serial cable connected to the computer was not working in python version 3, so we are having to use python 2.7.
Once we installed python 2.7 and installed the py serial module with pip install we were able to then controll the roomba via the keyboard.

JOEL broke the touchscreen!!! So we had to get a replacement.
